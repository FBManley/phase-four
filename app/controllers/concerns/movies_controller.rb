# custom routes break RESTful conventions. to keep RESTful- create new controller, such as Birds::LikesController, and add an update action in this controller
# def increment_likes
#     bird = Bird.find_by(id: params[:id])
#     if bird
#       bird.update(likes: bird.likes + 1)

#       render json: { error: "Bird not found" }, status: :not_found
#     end
#   end
# in routes- custom action = custom route patch "/birds/:id/like", to: "birds#increment_likes"
# whenever I have the inclination that I want to add a method on a controller thatâ€™s not part of the default five or whatever REST actions that we have by default, make a new controller! And just call it that.
